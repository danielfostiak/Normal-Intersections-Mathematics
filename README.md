# Normal-Intersections-Mathematics
A short visualiser I created when I was working on a very interesting, self-created mathematics problem.

The problem was roughly something like this: 'For any given point in the cartesian plane, find a rule which dictates the number of normals to the curve $\y=x^2$ that intersect that point'.

The problem is very nice and only requires elementary methods in calculus, such as differentiation and the understanding of normals.

After solving this problem I came to the answer of a line which separated the cartesian plane into two sections, the region above the line contained all points with 3 normals that intersect, the region below contained all points which had 1 normal, and on the line itself had points which had 2 normals (or 1 normal, and 2 'repeated' normals.

The line is: $\y=frac{3x^23}{23}+frac{1}{2}$

$\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
